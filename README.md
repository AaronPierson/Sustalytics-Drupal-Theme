# Sustalytics-Drupal
Sustalytics is a service platform for brands and retailers to test products before producing them. 

For this project, I was responsible for creating a Shopify web app that retrieves store data for processing and also maintaining and updating the client's Webflow site. Additionally, I developed a solution that allows the client to post to their Drupal blog and automatically share the posts on social media.

Most of my work on this project involved the backend, using the PHP Shopify SDK library and following Shopify's official documentation. However, I also had the opportunity to work on the frontend of Drupal, modifying the Belgard theme to match the client's design and creating a custom content page. I also made some changes to the webform and the view that displays a list of posts. To do this, I created a new twig template, and added some styling which can be found here.
