# Sustalytics-Drupal
Sustalytics is a service platform for brands and retailers to test products before producing them. 

For this project, I was tasked with building a Shopify web app that pulls store data for processing. I also worked on the client's Webflow site and handle maintenance and any changes for the client. I've also built a solution for the client's blog allowing them to post once then automatically post to their other social media.

Even though this was mainly backend work I still had a chance to work on Drupal's front end. The code here on github is a sub theme updating the custom content page; so it matches better with the client's design.
